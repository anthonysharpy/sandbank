==== no definition.txt for collection "X" found ====

You have probably accidentally deleted the definition.txt file in the collection's folder. You should un-delete it. If you have lost it, you can write one manually. The file should look something like this:

{
  "DocumentClassTypeSerialized": "SandbankBenchmark.PlayerData",
  "CollectionName": "players"
}

Replace "SandbankBenchmark.PlayerData" with whatever type you're using. The format is NAMESPACE.CLASS_NAME.

Replace "players" with the name of your collection. It must match the name of the folder.

==== the CollectionName in the definition.txt differed from the name of the directory ====

"CollectionName" in the definition.txt must match the name of the folder it is in. Either re-name your folder or edit the definition.txt.

==== your JSON is probably invalid ====

The JSON is messed-up somehow. You need to repair it manually. Alternatively, you can delete the document if you don't care about it.

==== the filename does not match the ID ====

The name of the file must match the "ID" field in the document. Either change the file name or the value of the ID field so that they match.
